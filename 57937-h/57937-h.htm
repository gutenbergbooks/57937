<span class="i2">Over the skeleton woodlands and stretches forlorn,</span>
<span class="i2">Touching with pallor the forests, storm-haggard and torn;</span>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He rode, a king, amid the armoured knights,</span>
<span class="i0">The glory of day tossing on helm and shield,</span>
<span class="i0">And all the glory of his youth and joy,</span>
<span class="i0">In the strong, wine-like splendour of his face.</span>
<span class="i0">He rode among them, the one man of men,</span>
<span class="i0">Their lordliest, loveliest, he who might have been,</span>
<span class="i0">Because of very human breadth of love,</span>
<span class="i0">And his glad, winning sympathy for earth,</span>
<span class="i0">Greater than even Arthur under heaven.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">No bit of beauty earth had ever held,</span>
<span class="i0">Of child or flower or dream of woman’s face,</span>
<span class="i0">Or noble, passing godliness of mood,</span>
<span class="i0">In man toward man, but garnered in his eye,</span>
<span class="i0">As in some mere that gathereth all earth’s face,</span>
<span class="i0">And foldeth it in beauty to its breast.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He rode among them, Arthur’s own right hand,</span>
<span class="i0">Arthur, whom he loved as John loved Christ,</span>
<span class="i0">And watched each day with joy that lofty brow</span>
<span class="i0">Lift up its lonely splendour, isolate,</span>
<span class="i0">Half god-like, o’er that serried host of spears,</span>
<span class="i0">And knew his love the kingliest, holiest thing,</span>
<span class="i0">’Twixt man and man upon this glowing earth.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So passed those days of splendour and of peace,</span>
<span class="i0">When all men loved his majesty and strength</span>
<span class="i0">And kindliness of spirit which the king,</span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">&nbsp;&emsp;&ensp;[Pg 41]</a></span>
<span class="i0">’Twas Lancelot fought the mightiest in the lists,</span>
<span class="i0">And beat with thunders back the brazen shields,</span>
<span class="i0">And stormed the fastness of the farthest isles,</span>
<span class="i0">Slaying the grizzly warriors of the meres,</span>
<span class="i0">And winning all men’s fealty and love,</span>
<span class="i0">And worship of fair women in the towers,</span>
<span class="i0">Who laid their distaffs down to watch him pass;</span>
<span class="i0">And made the hot blood mantle each fair cheek,</span>
<span class="i0">With sweet sense of his presence, till all men</span>
<span class="i0">Called Arthur half a god, and Lancelot</span>
<span class="i0">The greatest heart that beat in his great realm.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then came that fatal day that brake his life,</span>
<span class="i0">When he, being sent of Arthur, all unknowing,</span>
<span class="i0">Saw Guinevere, like some fair flower of heaven,</span>
<span class="i0">As men may only see in dreams the gods</span>
<span class="i0">Do send to kill the common ways of earth,</span>
<span class="i0">And make all else but drear and dull and bleak;</span>
<span class="i0">Such magic she did work upon his soul,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">&nbsp;&emsp;&ensp;[Pg 42]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Till Arthur, God and all the Table Round,</span>
<span class="i0">Were but a nebulous mist before his eyes,</span>
<span class="i0">In which the splendour of her beauty shone.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Henceforth the years would rise and wane and die,</span>
<span class="i0">And glory come and glory pass away,</span>
<span class="i0">And battles pass as in a troubled dream,</span>
<span class="i0">And Arthur be a ghost, and his knights ghosts;—</span>
<span class="i0">The castles and the lists and the mad fights,</span>
<span class="i0">Sacking of cities, scourging of country-sides,</span>
<span class="i0">All dreams before his eyes;—all, save her love.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So girded she her magic round his heart,</span>
<span class="i0">And meshed him in a golden mesh of love,</span>
<span class="i0">And marred his sense of all earth’s splendour there.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But in the after-days when brake the end,</span>
<span class="i0">And she had fled to Glastonbury’s cells,</span>
<span class="i0">With all the world one clamour at her sin;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">&nbsp;&emsp;&ensp;[Pg 43]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And Arthur like a storm-smit pine-tree stood,</span>
<span class="i0">Alone amid his kingdom’s blackened ruins;—</span>
<span class="i0">Then Lancelot knew his life an evil dream,</span>
<span class="i0">And thought him of the friendship of their youth,</span>
<span class="i0">And all the days that they had been together,</span>
<span class="i0">And “Arthur, Arthur,” spake from all the meres,</span>
<span class="i0">And “Arthur, Arthur,” moaned from days afar.</span>
<span class="i0">And Lancelot grieved him of his woeful sin:—</span>
<span class="i0">“And this the hand that smote mine Arthur down,</span>
<span class="i0">That brake his glory, ruined his great hope</span>
<span class="i0">Of one vast kingdom built on noble deeds,</span>

<span class="i0">This hand that should have been his truest strength,</span>
<span class="i0">Next to that high honour which he held.”</span>
<span class="i0">And all the torrents of his sorrow brake</span>
<span class="i0">For his own Arthur, Arthur standing lone,</span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">&nbsp;&emsp;&ensp;[Pg 44]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And then a woeful longing smote him there,</span>
<span class="i0">To ride by murk and moon, by mere and waste,</span>
<span class="i0">To where the king made battle with his foes,</span>
<span class="i0">And look, unknown, upon his face, and die.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So thinking this he fled, and the queen’s wraith,</span>

<span class="i0">But stronger with him fled his gladder youth</span>
<span class="i0">And all the memories of the splendid past,</span>
<span class="i0">Until his heart yearned for the days that were,</span>
<span class="i0">And that great, noble soul who fought alone.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then coming by cock-crow and the glimmering dawn,</span>
<span class="i0">He reached the grey-walled castle of the land,</span>
<span class="i0">Where the king tarried ere he went to fight</span>
<span class="i0">The last dread battle of the Table Round.</span>
<span class="i0">And the grim sentinels who guarded there,</span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">&nbsp;&emsp;&ensp;[Pg 45]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And judging by the sorrow of his face,</span>

<span class="i0">And pointing past the waning beacon fires,</span>
<span class="i0">Said, “There he sleeps as one who hath no woes.”</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And Lancelot passing silent left them there,</span>
<span class="i0">And entering the old abbey, (’twas some ruin</span>
<span class="i0">Of piety and worship of past days,)</span>
<span class="i0">Saw in the flicker of a dying hearth,</span>
<span class="i0">Mingled with faint glimmering of the dawn,</span>
<span class="i0">The great king sleeping, where a mighty cross</span>
<span class="i0">Threw its dread shadow o’er his moving breast.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And Lancelot knew the same strong, god-like face</span>
<span class="i0">That he had worshipped in the days no more,</span>

<span class="i0">And he had wept, but that his awful sin,</span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">&nbsp;&emsp;&ensp;[Pg 46]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Whereat he moaned, “O, noble, saintly heart,</span>

<span class="i0">Save for the awful sin that flames between,</span>

<span class="i27">Here the king</span>
<span class="i0">Stirred in his sleep, and murmured, “Guinevere!”</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And Lancelot feeling that an age of ages,</span>
<span class="i0">Hoary with all anguish of old crime</span>

<span class="i0">Betwixt him and the king at that one name,</span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then it did smite upon him he must die;</span>

<span class="i0">That he must die in battle, and go out</span>
<span class="i0">Where no dread sorrow could gnaw at his heart,</span>
<span class="i0">But all forgetting and eternal sleep.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Whereat the madness of old battle woke,</span>
<span class="i0">For his dread sin now burned all softness out,</span>
<span class="i0">And the glad kindliness of the Table Round,</span>
<span class="i0">And left him, shorn of all the Christian knight,</span>
<span class="i0">The gentle lord who only smote to save,</span>
<span class="i0">Or shield the helpless from the brutal stroke;</span>
<span class="i0">And flamed his heart there with the lust to slay,</span>

<span class="i2">But scarce an hour ago,</span>

<span class="i0">And often when the heart is worn</span>

<span class="i0">And by my side a young girl stands</span>
<span class="i2">With heaven in her eyes.</span>

<span class="i0">You are a dream, a face, a wraith,</span>
<span class="i2">You drift across my pain,</span>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
